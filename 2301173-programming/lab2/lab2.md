# Lab 2: Math and Selection

Imagine a grading system which accepts a score from the user. 
If the score is more than 50, it will show "passed" otherwise "failed".

We can see that the program has two choices to show on the screen. So, we will learn how to write a program with selection structures. 

In this lab you will learn about math operators and selection statements in Python.



## Math

Python has the following math operators:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `//` Floor Division
- `%` Modulus
- `**` Exponent

## Selection

Python has the following selection statements:

- `if`
- `elif`
- `else`

The syntax for an `if` statement is:

```python
if condition:
    # Code block
```

The syntax for an `if` statement with an `elif` is:

```python
if condition1:
    # Code block
elif condition2:
    # Code block
```

The syntax for an `if` statement with an `else` is:

```python
if condition:
    # Code block
else:
    # Code block
```
