# Lab 3: Repetition

So far, we have learn the sequence and selection structures where the program is executed sequentially line by line from the top to the bottom like a waterfall. 
Now, think about the program to print the numbers from 1 to 5, one number a line. We can just repeat the `print` function with different numbers as shown below.

```python
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
```
