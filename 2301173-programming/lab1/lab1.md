# Lab 1: Basic of Python

**Python is just an English language**

Read the code below, I believe that you understand it, don't you? :)

```python
song = input('What is your favourit song: ')
if song in your_favourite_song_list:
  play()
else:
  your_favourite_song_list.add(this_song)
  play()
```

In this lab you will learn about how python does some basic tasks such as printing, reading input, and basic data types.
